# Profiles REST API

I practice working with REST API by building and testing profiles and their
associated status feeds.

I fleshed out each component, on django 2.2, using a Vagrant Box of
Ubuntu Bionic Beaver to test the API. When finished, I decided to try to run
things on modern Django (at the time of writing this, django is currently
version 3.2.9) to see if it would break things, which, it did! Fortunately,
they were easy fixes.
